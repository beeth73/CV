[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Maintained-green.svg)]()


This repository hosts the source code (`.tex`) and compiled binaries (`.pdf`) of my professional resume. Maintained in version control because a career is an iterative process, not a static document.

## 📥 Downloads

| Version | Description | Use Case | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Digital** | Clean UI with embedded clickable hyperlinks. | Email, LinkedIn, ATS Uploads. | **[Download Digital PDF](hyperlink/Bhushan_Ladgaonkar_Resume.pdf)** |
| **Print** | Full URLs explicitly written out. | Physical Interviews, Career Fairs. | **[Download Print PDF](readable/Bhushan_Ladgaonkar_Resume_R.pdf)** |

> *Note: The Print version exposes full URLs (e.g., `github.com/beeth73`) because paper doesn't support `onClick` events yet.*

## 🛠 Build Instructions

This project is built using **LaTeX**.

You can compile the source code locally using any standard TeX distribution (TeX Live, MacTeX), or simply import the `.tex` files into **[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)** to edit and compile in the browser.
